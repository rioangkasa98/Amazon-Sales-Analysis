# 📊 Sales Transactions Analysis (MySQL)

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales transaction data using MySQL to uncover insights related to product performance, sales trends, and customer behavior.
The dataset contains transaction-level records including product details, pricing, quantity sold, customer information, and country.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL skills such as data cleaning, aggregation, conditional logic, and analytical querying.

## 2. Background

Sales transaction data is commonly used by businesses to evaluate performance, understand customer purchasing behavior, and identify growth opportunities.
By analyzing transactional data, businesses can make data-driven decisions related to product strategy, market focus, and customer retention.

## 3. Goal

The objectives of this project are:
- To analyze product sales performance
- To identify top-performing products and countries
- To understand customer purchasing patterns
- To practice SQL querying and data analysis using real-world data

## 4. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains sales transaction records, where each row represents a single product purchase within a transaction.

## 5. Approach Used

- **Data Cleaning**:
  1. Data Type Correction
     - Converted Date to proper date format
     - Ensured Price and Quantity were numeric
  2. Handling Missing Values
     - Remove Missing CustomerNo
     - Rows with missing product identifiers were removed
  3. Handling Inconsistent Values
     - Negative values in Quantity were Removed
  4. Handling Typos
     - Corrected inconsistent product names and country names

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
 EDA was conducted using SQL to better understand the dataset by:
  - Exploring sales distribution by product and country
  - Identifying top-selling products
  - Observing sales trends over time (monthly)
  - Analyzing customer purchasing behavio

## 6. Business Questions

- **Product**
  1. What is the total revenue generated by each product?
  2. Which product has the highest quantity sold?
  3. Which product generates the highest revenue?
  4. What is the average price per product?

- **Sales**
  1. What is the total revenue by country?
  2. Which country generates the highest revenue?
  3. How does total sales vary by month?
  4. What is the average quantity sold per transaction?

- **Customer**
  1. Which customer generates the highest total revenue?
  2. How many unique customers are in the dataset?
  3. What is the average number of products purchased per customer?

## 7. SQL Queries and Techniques
The analysis was performed using MySQL and includes:
- GROUP BY and aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Conditional logic using CASE WHEN
- Time-based analysis using date functions
- Calculated fields such as TotalRevenue
- Data labeling using derived columns (DayName, MonthName)
All SQL queries used to answer the business questions are included in this repository.

## 8. Key Insight
- A small number of products contribute significantly to total revenue
- Most transactions originate from a limited number of countries
- Customer purchasing behavior varies significantly in transaction volume
- Returns represent a small but notable portion of total transactions

## 9. Conclusion

**Summary**:
This project allowed me to explore the use of SQL in database design and analysis, while answering key business questions. Moving forward, I would explore further analyses using more advanced visualization tools or machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## 11. Technologies Used

**Tools and Languages**:
